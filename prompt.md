"One of the most significant challenges in Project-Based Learning (PBL) is the assessment of student learning. Unlike traditional education, where standardized tests and individual assignments dominate the evaluation process, PBL involves complex, collaborative, and often open-ended tasks that require a different approach. Assessing not only the final product but also the process, teamwork, creativity, problem-solving, and individual contributions can be difficult. Teachers must balance formative and summative assessments, use rubrics effectively, and often rely on subjective judgment to capture the depth of student learning. This complexity raises concerns about fairness, consistency, and the alignment of assessment methods with learning objectives."
