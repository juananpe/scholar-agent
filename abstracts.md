**1. On agent-based software engineering**
_NR Jennings - Artificial Intelligence, 2000 (Elsevier)_

Agent-based computing represents an exciting new synthesis both for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, more generally, Computer Science. It has the potential to significantly improve the theory and the practice of modeling, designing, and implementing computer systems. Yet, to date, there has been little systematic analysis of what makes the agent-based approach such an appealing and powerful computational model. Moreover, even less effort has been devoted to discussing the inherent disadvantages that stem from adopting an agent-oriented view. Here both sets of issues are explored. The standpoint of this analysis is the role of agent-based software in solving complex, real-world problems. In particular, it will be argued that the development of robust and scalable software systems requires autonomous agents that can complete their objectives while situated in a dynamic and uncertain environment, that can engage in rich, high-level social interactions, and that can operate within flexible organisational structures.

**2. Large language model-based agents for software engineering: A survey**
_J Liu, K Wang, Y Chen, X Peng, Z Chen, 2024 (arXiv)_

The recent advance in Large Language Models (LLMs) has shaped a new paradigm of AI agents, i.e., LLM-based agents. Compared to standalone LLMs, LLM-based agents substantially extend the versatility and expertise of LLMs by enhancing LLMs with the capabilities of perceiving and utilizing external resources and tools. To date, LLM-based agents have been applied and shown remarkable effectiveness in Software Engineering (SE). The synergy between multiple agents and human interaction brings further promise in tackling complex real-world SE problems. In this work, we present a comprehensive and systematic survey on LLM-based agents for SE. We collect 106 papers and categorize them from two perspectives, i.e., the SE and agent perspectives. In addition, we discuss open challenges and future directions in this critical domain.

**3. Agent-based software engineering**
_M Wooldridge - IEE Proceedings-software, 1997 (IET)_

The technology of intelligent agents and multi-agent systems is expected to alter radically the way in which complex, distributed, open systems are conceptualised and implemented. The paper considers the problem of building a multi-agent system as a software engineering enterprise. Three issues are focused on: how agents might be specified; how these specifications might be refined or otherwise transformed into efficient implementations; and how implemented agents and multi-agent systems might subsequently be verified, to show that they are correct with respect to their specifications. These issues are discussed with reference to a number of case studies. The paper concludes by setting out some issues and open problems for future research.

**4. Software engineering using autonomous agents: Are we there yet?**
_S Suri, SN Das, K Singi, K Dey, 2023 (ASE Conference)_

Autonomous agents equipped with Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly gaining prominence as a revolutionary technology within the realm of Software Engineering. These intelligent and autonomous systems demonstrate the capacity to perform tasks and make independent decisions, leveraging their intrinsic reasoning and decision-making abilities. This paper delves into the current state of autonomous agents, their capabilities, challenges, and opportunities in Software Engineering practices. By employing different prompts (with or without context), we conclude the advantages of context-rich prompts for autonomous agents. Prompts with context enhance user requirement understanding, avoiding irrelevant details that could hinder task comprehension and degrade model performance, particularly when dealing with complex frameworks such as Spring Boot, Django, Flask, etc. This exploration is conducted using Auto-GPT (v0.3.0), an open-source application powered by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 which intelligently connects the “thoughts” of Large Language Models (LLMs) to independently accomplish the assigned goals or tasks.

**5. Agent-oriented software engineering**
_NR Jennings - Modelling Autonomous Agents in Multi-Agent Systems, 1999 (Springer)_

Increasingly many computer systems are being viewed in terms of autonomous agents. Agents are being espoused as a new theoretical model of computation that more closely reflects current computing reality than Turing Machines. Agents are being advocated as the next generation model for engineering complex, distributed systems. Agents are also being used as an overarching framework for bringing together the component AI sub-disciplines that are necessary to design and build intelligent entities. Despite this intense interest, however, a number of fundamental questions about the nature and the use of agents remain unanswered. In particular: what is the essence of agent-based computing? what makes agents an appealing and powerful conceptual model? what are the drawbacks of adopting an agent-oriented approach? what are the wider implications for AI of agent-based computing?
