# Enhancement Report for "AI-Powered Evaluation in Software Engineering Education"

Based on the literature review, I recommend the following enhancements to strengthen the article:

## 1. Introduction Section Enhancements

The introduction already establishes the challenges in Software Engineering education and the need for automated assessment systems. However, it could be strengthened by incorporating the following recent findings:

- Add reference to **Messer et al. (2024)** to support the claim about limitations of existing automated assessment tools that focus primarily on functional correctness. Their systematic review of automated grading tools in programming education reveals that most tools provide limited feedback (typically just indicating test pass/fail status) rather than substantive guidance for improvement.

- Include insights from **Koutcheme et al. (2025)** who specifically evaluated language models for generating and judging programming feedback, highlighting the potential of LLMs to enhance the feedback process beyond traditional automated assessment methods.

- Integrate findings from **Wu and Chang (2023)** who specifically examined the application of generative AI to assessment in project-based learning contexts, contributing to generative AI skill assessment and PBL course design.

## 2. Background and Related Work Enhancements

### 2.1 The Need for AI in Software Engineering Education

This subsection can be strengthened by adding:

- Recent findings from **Jacobs and Jaschke (2024)** whose research shows that feedback generated by LLMs (specifically GPT-4) effectively addressed code errors in most cases, though challenges with incorrect suggestions and hallucinated issues indicate the need for careful implementation.

- Reference to **Divasón et al. (2023)** who propose an AI-based methodology to help evaluate complex projects in engineering and computer science courses. Their approach allows instructors to examine the influence of each assessment variable on the final grade, discover potential biases and inconsistencies, and generate appropriate rubrics to avoid them.

- Insights from **Menezes et al. (2024)** on AI-grading of standup updates in project-based learning contexts, demonstrating how AI can facilitate the evaluation of process-oriented activities in software engineering education.

### 2.2 AI-Driven Assessment and LLMs

This section can be enhanced with:

- Recent findings from **Gao et al. (2024)** who demonstrate the potential of LLMs for conceptual evaluation in engineering education, finding that GPT-4 achieved strong correlation with teaching assistant grading across multiple datasets.

- Reference to **Wang et al. (2025)** who conducted an empirical study examining whether LLMs can effectively replace human evaluators in software engineering contexts. Their research focuses on the alignment between LLM-based judgments and human assessments across multiple software engineering tasks.

- Inclusion of ethical considerations from **Chinta et al. (2024)** who provide a comprehensive evaluation of the literature on fairness, bias, and ethics in AI-driven educational systems, emphasizing the importance of these considerations in developing automated assessment technologies.

- Insights from **Soriano et al. (2024)** who explore challenges in AI-driven student assessment, noting that while AI can achieve commendable accuracy (90% in their study), issues of consistency, bias across demographic groups, and privacy concerns must be carefully addressed.

- Findings from **Simões et al. (2024)** who developed a comprehensive framework for evaluating software quality in educational contexts that goes beyond functional correctness to include design, documentation, and adherence to software engineering principles.

## 3. Recommended Additions to Citations

Several red-highlighted citations in the paper can be updated or expanded:

- **Divasón et al. (2023)** - This citation is already highlighted in red in the text. The abstract I retrieved confirms this is an excellent reference for the paper as it directly addresses AI-based methodologies for evaluating complex projects in engineering and computer science courses.

- **Wang et al. (2025)** - This paper is highly relevant as it empirically studies whether LLMs can effectively replace human evaluators in software engineering contexts.

- **Chinta et al. (2024)** - This reference adds an important ethical dimension to the discussion of AI-powered assessment.

- **Omughelli et al. (2024)** - Their work on factors affecting student performance with AI-enhanced learning provides valuable insights into implementation considerations.

- **FreeText** - I couldn't find specific information about this tool, but it could be replaced or supplemented with references to modern LLM-based assessment systems like those described in **Koutcheme et al. (2025)** or **Gabbay and Cohen (2024)**.

## 4. New Sections to Consider

Based on the literature review, consider adding these new sections or subsections:

### 4.1 Ethical Considerations in AI-Powered Assessment

This section would draw on work by **Chinta et al. (2024)**, **Soriano et al. (2024)**, and **Omughelli et al. (2024)** to address fairness, bias, privacy, and ethical implementation of AI-based assessment systems in educational contexts.

### 4.2 Balancing Automated and Human Assessment

This section could discuss the importance of maintaining appropriate human oversight while leveraging AI capabilities, drawing on findings from **Wang et al. (2025)** and **Gao et al. (2024)** about the alignment between LLM and human assessments.

### 4.3 Implementation Strategies for AI-Enhanced PBL

This section could provide practical guidance for educators seeking to implement AI-powered assessment in project-based learning contexts, based on the experiences documented in **Wu and Chang (2023)**, **Zheng et al. (2024)**, and **Menezes et al
